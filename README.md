Introductory course to web programming. All course materials were taught in Python and consisted primarily of learning the Python lanaguage and using it for managing and manipulating datasets.

This repo includes some assignment work on learning to use pandas to manipulate data.

There is also a project that consists of building a simple web portal using the Qt toolkit in Python with PyQt5. The project is an example of a bookstore management system with user authentication, admin privliges, inventory management, cart system, as well as an order logging system.
